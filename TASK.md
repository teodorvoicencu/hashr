Create an API for an HR system that returns JSON. 
An example JSON file is attached to this email.

Following data set will be provided as an array of objects:
Unique Identifier - First Name - Last Name - DOB - Industry - Annual income - other fields

We would like you to use Django to build the API. Can use any database of choice for holding the data.

The API should support the following operations on the included dataset:
Read all (sorting, pagination, filtering provided as parameters)
Read one
Update one
Delete one

The API should also be able to return the following statistics on a set of different endpoints from the above (Pandas implementation):
Average age per industry
Average salaries per industry
Average salaries per years of experience
Based on the dataset, other “interesting” statistics

Basic validation should be in place for the above operations where required


Emphasis is based on the clarity and quality of the code and the implementation of the functionality outlined above, and not on the overall design of the application.
